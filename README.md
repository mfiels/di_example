# di_example

An example of using inject.dart in Flutter.

This required some changes to inject.dart to get it to work with Flutter. Those changes are pushed to [my inject.dart fork](https://github.com/mfiels/inject.dart).

To run code generation and output the compiled injection code:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```
